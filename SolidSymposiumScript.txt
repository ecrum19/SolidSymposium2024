Solid Symposium Script:

S1 - Genome sequencing in Health Care
	Sequencing over the past 20 years has gotten A LOT cheaper
	There are now companies claiming we can attain a $100 WGS
	
	The decreses in costs have also been correlated/coincided with an increase medical applications
		i.e. Cancer stuff / Pharmacogenomics / Rare diseases / etc.
	With these aynergistic advances, "Personalized Medicine" is becoming more "realistic"

S2 - The challenges ahead (scaling)
	storage (need graphic)
	privacy / governance
	interoperability
	
	Data SHARING ?

S3 - A tangable example --> 
	0. A physician has a new patient who was recently hospitalized with DVT (they need to be put on a blood thinner)
	1. Warfarin is the most popular -- but outcomes are known to be linked to the presence of specific genotypes
		(CYP2C9 and VKORC1)
	2. So, the physician needs the patient's genomic info for presctiption
	3. Also, the treating physician is not the patient's primary physician -- thus the other physician should be consulted
